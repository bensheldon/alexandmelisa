            <h2>How we met</h2>
            <p>
              When Melisa was told that Alex was on the "dateable" list of San Marcos teachers that the ladies kept, she was curious to met him. When she found out he went to China, she knew she had to met him. However, their first introduction didn't go so well so she skipped him on the list. It wasn't until the SM holiday party when they sat next to eachother did they click. They shared laughs and stories over their mutual love of traveling but he still didn't ask her out. It wasn't until they saw each other again at an IEP meeting that he finally asked her out over gchat. It was a simple and short chat and they are forever grateful that Kevin Doung had his IEP that day.

        <h2>How we got engaged</h2>
        <p>Alex had to drag her out of the house one cold and chilly evening. With the fire going and watching Teen Mom under a blanket, she refused two times. It wasn't until he insisted that he wanted to see the sunset did she give in. Not seeing a ring box in his pockets, she proceed to complain and drag her feet the whole way. Chili and Pepper on the other hand were happy and running around as they were in on the secret. When he asked to sit on a rock, she became excited because they never sit during their power walks to watch the sunset. Sure enough as the sun was going down, he bended on one knee and proposed to her as the sky turned red. She happily accepted many years of joy with him.
